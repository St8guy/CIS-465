			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<h4><p>This project will entail the implementation of two methods separating the background of an image from the foreground. 
			Specifically of a greyscale image as the background and foreground typically have very different intensity levels inside of each class. 
			The first of which is Otsu where the image will be split up into two classes by a threshold value [1]. 
			Pixels with intensity values below the threshold being mapped to one value, and those above being mapped to another value. 
			The Adaptive progressive thresholding approach is the second method, which is an extension of the Otsu method [2]. 
			Following the same process but continuing past the end of the Otsu method, where the threshold value is used to Quantize the original value [2], 
			and then the process is repeated on that new image.</h4>
