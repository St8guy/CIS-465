			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
			<h4>From what I observed of the two processes, Otsu and APT, they are largely effective under specific curcumstances. 
			As seen with the coin and image1 they very effectively seperated the background and foreground in a distinct fashion. 
			But in more complex frames they both quickly fell apart, resulting in the foreground and background being more blended together, 
			as seen with the lena and image2 photos.
